# SCUBA Simulator

**SCUBA Simulator** is a first person exploration/simulation game created in Unity where the player is tasked with traversing a physically based world, uncovering mysteries whilst managing their depth and dwindling gas supply.

## Features
- Accurate diving physics (buoyancy, gas consumption etc.)
- Dive with different gas mixtures such as Nitrox and Trimix
- Feel the effects of depth and pressure with a full nitrogen narcosis simulation
- Have full control over your BCD (Buoyancy Control Device) and switch at anytime to your backup camera
- Recieve important statistics such as ascent rate and maximum operating depth on your dive computer and pressure gauge
- Physically based environment (volumetric fog, volumetric clouds, ocean simulation)

### Detailed Description
**Buoyancy**: Player buoyancy is calculated based on current depth, inflation amount of their BCD as well as the mass & volume of their body and equipment

**Gas Consumption**: Calculated with respect to real time depth, surface air consumption rate as well as current exertion

**Gas Mixes**: Different partial pressures and percentages of oxygen, nitrogen and helium result in different MODs (maximum operating depths) as well as susceptibility to nitrogen narcosis
